Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada: 52% of its residents are not native English speakers, 48.9% are native speakers of neither English nor French, and 50.6% of residents belong to visible minority groups.Vancouver is consistently named as one of the top five worldwide cities for livability and quality of life, and the Economist Intelligence Unit acknowledged it as the first city ranked among the top ten of the world's most well-living cities for ten consecutive years\n\nAs of 2011, Vancouver is the most densely populated city in Canada. Urban planning in Vancouver is characterized by high-rise residential and mixed-use development in urban centres, as an alternative to sprawl.Vancouver has been called a \"city of neighbourhoods\". Each neighbourhood in Vancouver has a distinct character and ethnic mix. People of English, Scottish, and Irish origins were historically the largest ethnic groups in the city, and elements of British society and culture are still visible in some areas, particularly South Granville and Kerrisdale.\n\nSince the 1980s, immigration increased substantially, making the city more ethnically and linguistically diverse; 53% of Vancouver's residents do not speak English as their first language. Almost 30% of the city's inhabitants are of Chinese heritage.This also has an advantage, since our target is based on opening a Sushi restaurant.\n\nHaving such vast population and big geographical area, there also exists big competition between businesses. Therefore it became very challenging for stake holder or new business to decide which area they should start their business to get higher revenue with lowest possible competition.And because of its diverse ethnicity, the business should be situated in such a place that it attracts a lot of customers.\n\nTarget Audience: New Business who wants to open a restaurant in Vancouver.\n\nThis project try to solve the above problem by suggesting the Target Business stake holders the right place to open new restaurants and gaining maximum profits in Vancouver."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
