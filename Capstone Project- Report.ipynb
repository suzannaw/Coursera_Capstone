With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) proper had a 2016 population of 6,417,516. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.\n\nThe diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants. While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city.\n\nToronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.\n\nHaving such vast population and big geographical area, there also exists big competition between businesses. Therefore it became very challenging for stake holder or new business to decide which area they should start their business to get higher revenue with lowest possible competition.And because of its diverse ethnicity, the business should be situated in such a place that it attracts a lot of customers.\n\n### Target Audience: \n                      New Business who wants to open a restaurant in Tornoto.\n\nThis project try to solve the above problem by suggesting the Target Business stake holders the right place to open new restaurants and gaining maximum profits in Toronto."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## DATA DESCRIPTION:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": " Based on the business problem set forward, the factors that we will be considering to ensure that the restaurant is being opened in a good location are as follows:\n - The people residing in the Neighborhood(The age group and their income)\n - The other Restaurants situated in the specified area\n - The Trending places in the surrounding Neighborhood that might attract people\n\nFollowing data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\n\n- Centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n\n- Number of restaurants in the neighborhood and their type and location  will be obtained using Foursquare API"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## METHODOLOGY"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The ulterior motive of our study in this particular report is to find a best location for opening a new Restaurant in Toronto, one of the most populated city in Canada. \n\nSo for achieving this we have put into use the data consisting of the postal codes from Toronto and the list of Restaurants situated in the respective Neighborhood.\n\nTo solve the problem, we are going to cluster all the Neighborhoods in Toronto. And for this we are going to use a special Clustering \"K-Means Clustering\". K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity. The results of the K-means clustering algorithm are:\n\nThe centroids of the K clusters, which can be used to label new data Labels for the training data (each data point is assigned to a single cluster)\n\nThe Folium package would be used to give visualization to all the analysis that we are carrying out by plotting all the areas into maps.\n\nThe steps followed for the analysis are as follows:\n\n- Collection of Data which is required.Data: location and type (category) of every restaurant within our lat and lng. We have also the type of resutaurants in particular locality.\n\n- Explored the 'restaurant density' across different areas of Toronto - we will use K- mean to identify a few promising areas close to center with low number of restaurants and their type.\n\n- The Next step would be to make every Neighborhood onto their Clusters and take into consideration locations with less restaurants in radius of 500 meters.This would be an important factor because the business will only thrive if we ensure that the competition is less within the neighborhood.Then we will plot all the clustered Neighborhood using a map."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## ANALYSIS AND RESULTS"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#### Data identifiaction, capturing and cleaning.\n                              The first step in our analysis is to capture the Data source from the required Locations.Here we are using 2 datas, one from Wikipedia and the other from FoursquareAPI. The data about the postal codes of Canada is obtained from Wikipedia by the help of a library package named as 'BeautifulSoup'. Then we remove all the redundant value(data cleaning). Then the obtained Dataset is saved into a dataframe with three columns: Postal Code,Borough and Neighborhood. Then we combine neighborhood similar Bronx. Now the data is clean and ready to use.\n\n#### Combining different data source and sorting neighborhood based on Longitude and latitude\n                                     Now, we will combine neighborhood dataset with postal address and dataset with Latitude & Longitude and save them it separate data frame.The resultant data frame with contain details aabout Postal code, Brough, Neighborhood, Latitude & Longitude.This new Dataset is then visualized into a map.\n                                     \n#### Explore the Toronto's neighborhoods\n            Firstly, we explored all the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto, using the Latitude & Longitude data, using Foursquare API to get the Restaurant venues available in Toronto.The dataset is cleaned to get the unique venues for each Neighborhood.We then filter out the Restaurants from the Venue details. Then we sort each Neighborhood for the top most common venues used by people.Then we find the top 10 amongst the list and leave it upto the Stakeholders for the decision.\n\n#### Clustering\n               We are clustering the city of Toronto into a cluster of five. That is the value of k will be 5. Now we use the K-Means Clustering to come up with 5 clusters in Toronto woth similar set of venues. We are going to explore each cluster based on various factors to differentiate the discriminating venie categories that explicitly differentiate each cluster. The Neighborhoods with the maximum number of Restaurants in their surrounding will be selected for further exploration."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### RESULTS"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "From the analysis, we deduce the fact that although there is flood of restaurants in Toronto, there is a slight scarcity of restaurants as we move towards the city center.We have 4 boroughs and 74 neighborhoods inside geograpical coordinate of 43.653963, -79.387207.\n\nAs in accordance with our assumption,the cluster with the maximum number of Restaurants in our vicinity proves a good and thriving place for a startup. Although the places with a very few restaurants may prove successful because of the less competition there, we are focussed on regions with more restaurants because of the greater probability of the restaurant becoming a success because of the population in the Neighborhood.\n\nBased on our initial assumption of the cluster with maximum number of restaurants will have the best possibility to have a new restaurant due to the need in the area. Based on the resultant clusters it looks like Cluster 1 and Cluster 5 have higher number of resturants then rest of the clusters.\n\nThe Recommended places are onlt considered as the inital places which are shortlisted for anymore further analysis on a various of conditions that has to be met before the business idea is finalized. Because the Location and the competition might not be the only reasons to be doted upon.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## CONCLUSION"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The main purpose of this study was to do a complete study and to give a detailed report to the Stakeholders of the list of possible thriving and possible places so that they can narrow down their search to the list suggested. The Restaurant density Distribution that we have calculated, gives us the list of Borough which will satisfy some of the considerations and help us move further with our analysis.\n\nTHe clustering of the locations are done basically to segment the entire area into seperate zones of Neighborhoods so that the analysis is easier to perform and the addresses of those zones were used as starting points for the stakeholders to begin their final search.\n\nThe final decision on the location will be in the hands of the stakeholders and this decision is based on various characteristics as follows:\n- The levels of noise. For example the restaurant should not be in a place where the customers cannot eat in peace.\n- THe proximity to the major roads so that is easily commutable\n- THe real estate availability\n- The attractiveness of the Location. The location of various trending hotspots and tourist places will welcome a lot of population on a daliy basis.\n- Prices, Social and Economic dynamics of every Neighborhood.\n- The availability of resources such as water also plays important role.\n\nOur work as a data scientist is to make sure that our Stakeholders have ample data required. The list should be elaborate and clear and visually pleasing so as to allow them in making the right decision."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
